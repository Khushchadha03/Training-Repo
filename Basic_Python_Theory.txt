File functions:

r+ read + overwrite no truncate - from start
w+ read + overwrite truncate
a+ read + append no truncate - from end

in OOPs concept it will directly call init function in python

Abstraction - Hiding the implementation details in a class(like unnecessary details)
Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
Inheritance - class drives sthe property from another class
Polymorphism - many ways to use (Operator Overloading)

Dunder Functions - They are used to define how objects of a custom class interact with built-in Python operations and functions.

for non negative values - abs(a-b) absolute value
for no remainder values - a//b
