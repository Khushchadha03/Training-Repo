Different ways to make an Enviornment 
using python command
python -m venv myenv - default env will be setup
for activating in myenv and then scripts and then activate deactivate will be there
to activate - myenv\Scripts\activate (so my enviornment is activated)
 or you can download with pip install numpy or pandas
for later if you hv n number of library you can create a requirements.txt
for deactivate just write deactivate


2nd way mainly for linux commands itself
pip install virtualenv 
virtualenv -p python3 virtual_env
for activating --- virtual_env\Scripts\activate   
deactivate
.gitignore for ignoring installed_libraries/virtual_env to upload on github


3rd way /// BEST WAY Because it will not store any libraries in repos and we can use python other versions and also we can use in any system like linux,mac or Windows. The code will remain same
conda create --name name
conda activate
deactivate
conda remove --name name --all
pip install -r requirements.txt  ----- for libraries
